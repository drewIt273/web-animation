# Web Animation

A collection of focused animations built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to explore motion, interaction, and UI behavior on the web.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a playground for:
- Practicing web animation fundamentals
- Exploring UI interactions and transitions
- Improving frontend skills through well-defined, finished experiments

Each page focuses on a **single idea or theme**, combining multiple animations and interactions into a cohesive exploration.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- VS Code
- Chrome

No frameworks, no libraries — just core web technologies.

## 📁 Structure

The repository is organized by **ideas or themes**, where each folder represents a complete web page focused on exploring a specific concept.

Example:
- `light-effects/`
- `motion-basics/`
- `hover-interactions/`

Each folder contains a full web page showcasing multiple animations related to the same idea, typically including:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

This approach allows deeper exploration of a single concept per page, combining multiple animations and interactions into a cohesive experiment.
